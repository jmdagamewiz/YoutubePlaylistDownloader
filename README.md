# Youtube Playlist Downloader App: A WPF App
This app lets you download whole *video playlists* from YouTube with the option to choose download quality and to exclude specified videos from being downloaded.

## How to Use:
1. First, go to the releases section, found on the right side of this page.
2. Click on the link with the *Latest* tag, and click the YouTube.Playlist.Downloader.zip link to download.
3. Unzip the downloaded file and click the YouTubePlaylistDownloader.exe file to run the app.
4. When running the .exe file, a Windows prompt may warn you about this file. If this happens, click on the "More info" button then the "Run anyway" button. This happens because I currently don't have a digital license that will let Windows know who created the app.
5. After this, you should now be able to use the app. Enter any **public** playlist URL from YouTube for it to work.
6. Click the *Search* button after entering the URL and the *Download* button once you're ready to start downloading. Both buttons will become unclickable in the mean time while searching or downloading.
7. The downloaded playlist will show up in the folder specified in the bottom left side of the app. You can change it by pressing the *Change download folder* button.
8. When downloading finishes, you can now open the downloaded videos.
